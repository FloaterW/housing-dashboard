# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to publish your housing dashboard to GitHub:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - Repository name: `housing-dashboard`
   - Description: `A modern housing market dashboard with real-time analytics for the Greater Toronto Area`
   - Choose "Public" or "Private"
   - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Local Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/housing-dashboard.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages (Optional)

To host your dashboard for free on GitHub Pages:

1. First, install the GitHub Pages package:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

2. Add these scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  ...existing scripts...,
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

3. Add homepage to your `package.json`:

```json
"homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/housing-dashboard"
```

4. Deploy to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

5. Go to your repository Settings > Pages and ensure the source is set to "gh-pages" branch

Your dashboard will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/housing-dashboard`

## 4. Alternative: Deploy to Vercel

For a more professional deployment with custom domains:

1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/Login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Click "Deploy"

Vercel will automatically deploy your app and provide a URL.

## Repository Structure

Your repository should now contain:

- Complete React application with Tailwind CSS
- Interactive charts using Recharts
- Responsive design for all devices
- Real-time housing market data visualization
- Regional and housing type filters

## Next Steps

1. Customize the data in `src/data/housingData.js` with real data
2. Add more regions or housing types
3. Implement data fetching from a real API
4. Add user authentication for personalized dashboards
5. Create additional visualizations and insights

Happy coding! ðŸš€
